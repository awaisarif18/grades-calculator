The decentralized web—Web 3.0—is not just a buzzword, it’s an evolving ecosystem promising trustless transactions, user sovereignty, and programmable finance. If you’re a modern developer wondering where to start, buckle in for this step‑by‑step roadmap through smart contracts, DAOs, NFT platforms, and more.

## Stage 1: Foundations

1. **Blockchain Basics**: Ethereum vs Solana vs Polkadot. Understand consensus models (PoW, PoS, dPoS).
2. **Development Environment**: Install Node.js, Truffle/Hardhat, Ganache (local testnet).
3. **Solidity & Smart Contracts**: Write, test, and deploy a simple “Hello, World!” contract.

## Stage 2: Tooling & Infrastructure

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect MetaMask or WalletConnect to your dApp UI.
- **IPFS & Storage**: Learn to pin data with Pinata or NFT.storage for off‑chain assets.
- **Subgraphs**: Use The Graph to index contract events and build performant queries.

## Stage 3: Building Your First dApp

1. **Front‑End Framework**: Next.js with wagmi/web3.js for blockchain calls.
2. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Implement buy/sell functions, handle gas fees, and display transaction statuses.
3. **UI/UX Patterns**: Loading states for pending transactions, error handling, and wallet connections.

## Stage 4: Security & Best Practices

- **Audits**: Run Slither, MythX, and manual code reviews.
- **Upgradable Contracts**: Use OpenZeppelin’s upgradeable proxy pattern.
- **Key Management**: Secure private keys with hardware wallets or custodial solutions.

## Stage 5: Governance & DAOs

- **Token Creation**: Mint an ERC‑20 governance token.
- **Voting Systems**: Integrate Snapshot voting dashboards.
- **Treasury Management**: Deploy multisig wallets (Gnosis Safe).

## Stage 6: Scaling & Layer 2

- **Rollups**: Deploy on Optimism or Arbitrum to reduce gas costs.
- **Sidechains**: Explore Polygon and zk‑Rollups for specialized use cases.

## Continuous Learning

> **Stay Updated**: Follow core dev calls, read EIPs, and join decentralized communities on Discord and Telegram.

By following this roadmap, you’ll move from zero to a full‑stack Web 3.0 developer equipped to build the decentralized applications of tomorrow.
